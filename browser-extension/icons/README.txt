Icon Files for The Homies Chat Notifications Extension

You need to create the following icon files for the extension to work properly:

1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels
4. icon16-gray.png - 16x16 pixels (grayscale version for inactive state)
5. icon48-gray.png - 48x48 pixels (grayscale version for inactive state)
6. icon128-gray.png - 128x128 pixels (grayscale version for inactive state)

You can:
1. Use an existing logo from The Homies Chat application
2. Create a simple icon using an image editor like GIMP, Photoshop, or online tools
3. Use a free icon from sites like Flaticon.com or Icons8.com

A simple chat bubble or notification bell icon would work well.

For the grayscale versions, use the same icons but desaturated to indicate the inactive state.

Place all these files in this directory before loading the extension into your browser.
